Ongoing Project - On hold because it hurt me and now I'm scared of it.

Arduino Uno

Homemade MOSFET speed control circuit

Headway LiFePO4 Cells in series for 48V

Only one wheel is driven and will probably be a massive issue for torque-steer.

Probably going to kill the skateboard and repurpose the hardware for a scooter or small go-kart.
It is just too much power for a skateboard. Nearly cracked a rib and elbow on its maiden voyage.

** Electrical **

Driver failed close. Need additional MOSFET protection and cut-off circuits.

** Program **

It's whatever. Mocked up some quick logic for its first ride and I completely regret not capping the PWM to the MOSFET's to something reasonable.
